        <p>Hi I am Darren <br> I am a recent Dundalk Institute of Technology graduate with a diploma in Sound Design and Implementation. 
            I create sound through recording and synthesis combining them into wonderful sounds that you might have never heard before. 
            Hearing the sounds in different games and VR projects is a joy for me. Working with like minded people coming up with sonic solutions and 
            knowing how to implement them into a project makes me a valued member of a team.
            If you know someone who is interested in unique sounds, feel free to send them my way.<br>
            The sounds I have created for this webpage are a mixture of programing procedural sound and using sound that I created.<br>

        <p>Being a DJ has lead me to becoming an electronic music producer and I use various different mixing techniques,
             analogue synthesizers and software to produce sounds and music.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="part2">
        <p> Finding the right tone, tweeking knobs, pressing 
            buttons or the slide of a mouse to get the right amount of modulation or sythnesis is what gets me out of bed in the morning.
            Creating all types of different sounds in different ways can be a fascinating journey of sonic discovery.</p>

        <p>For my final college project I was assigned a scene taken for the Unity store which was free to use.<br>
           The scene had no sound so the brief was to interpret the scene and add sounds accordingly.<br>
           All the sounds are either sounds I created using synthesis or foley sounds that I recorded.<br>
